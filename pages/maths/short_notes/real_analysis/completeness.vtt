The assumption about the real number system we start with is that we insist that it builds on the rational numbers and does not contain any gaps.


00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:22.000
The property of not having any gaps is captured through the Axiom of Completeness.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:35.000
The Axiom of Completeness leads to the Nested Interval Property, which can be thought of a more natural way to express that the real numbers have no gaps.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:50.000
The Axiom of Completeness also leads to these results which indicate how the rational numbers are arranged within the real numbers.


00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
The rational numbers are dense in the reals. 
The irrational numbers are also dense in the reals.

Cantor, with his work on infinite sets, made precise the idea that the irrational numbers far outnumber the rational numbers.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Cantor initially published his discovery that the real numbers are uncountable in 1874, but in 1891 he offered another proof using decimal numbers that is startling in its simplicity. 


00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:34.000
In this proof, we would first need to show that the open interval (0,1) is uncountable, and then show that the real numbers are uncountable iff (0,1) is uncountable.


00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Having established that the rational numbers were countable, and that the real numbers were uncountable, Cantor considered whether there were infinities "above" that of the real numbers. 


00:00:50.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Cantor's theorem establishes a hierarchy of infinite sets that continues well beyond the continuum of the real numbers.

Dedekind's construction of the real numbers is useful because the verification of completeness is done in terms of upper bounds.


00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:22.000
The real numbers constructed in this way are not strictly numbers, but sets of rational numbers. To make this resemble a number system, we must further impose an algebraic structure on it.


00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:34.000
We can verify that the real numbers constructed in this way satisfy field and order properties by defining the operations of addition and multiplication and ordering in terms of the cuts.


00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:46.000
An earlier approach by Cantor to construct the real numbers involves characterising completeness with the assertion that "Cauchy sequences converge"


00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Given a Cauchy sequence of rational numbers, we can see that it converges, just not in the rational numbers. Cantor's idea was to define a real number to be the entire Cauchy sequence.


00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:10.000
The fact that there can be two Cauchy sequences that converge to the same value can be addressed by defining a real number to be the equivalence class of Cauchy sequences which converge to the same value.

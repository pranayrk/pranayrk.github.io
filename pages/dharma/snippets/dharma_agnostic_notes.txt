There are those of us that are born Hindu, but are not blessed with a great deal of faith.

It is sometimes claimed that there is a place for such an agnostic within the Hindu fold. 

Historically, it is stated that even the more orthodox (Astika) schools have has proponents that are agnostic. However, these are overly technical and far removed. 

Let us outline our goals neatly, we want to remain agnostic while being Hindu, that is, while affirming the truth of the Vedas. We want to become practicing Hindus.

We also might take inspiration from other Nastik traditions, while building a framework more suited to practicing modern Hinduism.

A Hindu might start their journey with Gods, prayer or the Gita, but we need to start from something far more basic. 

Our path is not so straightforward, we have not been blessed with the wings of faith. And so, we must crawl on a solid path of logic and sensibility to reach the heights that are promised to the practioners of Dharma.

And it seems to me, that once we have constructed such a path, and our beliefs align with the masses

The problem is this, we have to start with something so basic that it comes naturally to those with faith. 

And we will spend a lot of time on these simple things. 


Let us start with the basic requirements.

We do not want to believe in some notion of a God.
